My name is Pete, I paint and I'm paralysed from the chest down, I have been since I was 18 because of a benign spinal tumor and a condition called Syringomyelia. I started painting in 2005. I had my spine straightened and Infused and during the second phase of the operation I came around with quite limited dexterity and limited use of my arms. Painting became a form of physical rehabilitation, but also turned out to be psychological rehabilitation. Part of the reason for painting landscapes and seascapes is because I grew up on Gower. It's a beautiful part of the world. There are places that I can't go anymore and things that I can't see and painting is a way of embracing an element of my own agency, perhaps missing agency, and reliving aspects of my childhood. And I suppose offering my thoughts and feelings to others with regards to their own memories and experiences.
